      "I became interested in programming when I came into contact with bots from a game I played and enrolled at the Federal University of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys (UFVJM) in the Information Systems course. Although I didn't complete the course, my interest in the area didn't diminish. I continued trying to improve myself self-taught and I continue trying to learn daily. I made this site to show a little of what I know and I'm looking for my first opportunity in the area.",
